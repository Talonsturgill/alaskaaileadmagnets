description: Render engine + QA harness for Alaska.Ai LinkedIn carousel slides. Turns per-slide HTML/CSS/SVG/Canvas art into exact 1080x1350 PNGs (2x scale), a vector-text PDF for LinkedIn upload, feed-size thumbnails, and a contact sheet — with objective machine QA (render errors, missing fonts, clipped/offscreen/tiny text, contrast estimates, safe-zone violations). Use whenever building or reviewing carousel slides. The engine is a HARNESS, not a template — every deck's art is bespoke code written per run.

# carousel-engine — render + QA harness

The quality layer is fixed; the art is not. Slides are hand-coded HTML files
(one per slide) using any mix of CSS, SVG, Canvas 2D, D3, and the committed
art libraries. This engine renders them deterministically, checks them
objectively, and assembles the deliverables.

## Pipeline (per run)

```bash
bash .claude/skills/carousel-engine/bootstrap.sh          # once per session; installs pip deps

# 1. write slides to      out/<run>/slides/slide-01.html ... slide-NN.html
python .claude/skills/carousel-engine/render.py \
    --slides-dir out/<run>/slides --out-dir out/<run>/render        # PNGs + render_report.json
python .claude/skills/carousel-engine/qa.py --render-dir out/<run>/render   # machine_qa.json, exit!=0 on FAIL
python .claude/skills/carousel-engine/assemble.py \
    --slides-dir out/<run>/slides --render-dir out/<run>/render \
    --out-dir out/<run>/final --title "<document title>"            # carousel.pdf (VECTOR text) + contact sheet + thumbs
```

Re-render only fixed slides with `--only 3,7`. Read every report; never ship a
FAIL. `qa.py` warnings are advisories for the pixel critics, not free passes.

## Slide HTML contract

- One file per slide: `slide-01.html`, `slide-02.html`, ... Design for the
  viewport: exactly **1080x1350 CSS px**. `margin: 0`; nothing may scroll.
- Reference committed assets ONLY via the `@@ASSETS@@` token (the engine
  resolves it to an absolute `file://` path):
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="@@ASSETS@@/fonts/fonts.css">
  <script src="@@ASSETS@@/js/noise.js"></script>      <!-- AK.simplex2/fbm2/warp2/rng -->
  <script src="@@ASSETS@@/js/aktype.js"></script>      <!-- AK.fitText display fit-to-box -->
  <script src="@@ASSETS@@/js/aklabel.js"></script>     <!-- AK.canvasLabel knockout-plate labels -->
  <script src="@@ASSETS@@/js/ak3d.js"></script>        <!-- AK3D software 3D renderer -->
  <script src="@@ASSETS@@/js/zdog.min.js"></script>    <!-- Zdog pseudo-3D (no GPU) -->
  <script src="@@ASSETS@@/js/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
  <script src="@@ASSETS@@/js/topojson-client.min.js"></script>
  ```
  Geodata via `fetch("@@ASSETS@@/geo/alaska-state.geo.json")` (boroughs,
  us-states, world-land, alaska-places also available). **NO external URLs,
  no CDNs, no Google Fonts** — render.py rejects any `http(s)://` reference.
- **Async art must gate the screenshot**: set
  `window.renderReady = new Promise(resolve => { ...draw, then resolve() })`.
  The engine awaits it (30s cap). Without it you get a 400ms grace only.
- **Canvas = 2x backing store.** Any `<canvas>` styled at `W x H` CSS px must
  have `canvas.width = W*2; canvas.height = H*2; ctx.scale(2,2)`. Screenshots
  are taken at deviceScaleFactor 2 and the PDF embeds the canvas bitmap — a
  1x canvas ships blurry.
- **Text is HTML/SVG, never canvas.** Canvas text rasterizes in the PDF;
  HTML/SVG text stays vector, survives LinkedIn's recompression, and feeds
  LinkedIn's semantic ranker + accessibility mode. Draw art on canvas; set
  type in DOM/SVG layers above it.
- Mark intentionally-tiny or bleeding text (footers, coordinates, watermark
  type used as texture) with `data-decorative` so QA doesn't flag it:
  `<div data-decorative class="coords">61°13'N</div>`
  Both `data-decorative` and `data-overlap-ok` inherit to descendants.
- **Text may never overprint text**: qa.py FAILS when two elements' text
  line boxes intersect (the 2026-07-08 slide-3 defect class). Deliberate
  layering (a chip on an opaque plate crossing a display line box) must be
  declared with `data-overlap-ok` on the floating element — the gate then
  warns instead, and the pixel critics judge it.
- Determinism: seed all noise (`AK.reseed(seed)`, `AK.rng(seed)`). Derive the
  seed from the run date. Same inputs must reproduce the same pixels.
- Fonts: use `assets/fonts/fonts.css` families — Fraunces (100-900 + italic,
  opsz), JetBrains Mono (400/500/700), Space Grotesk (300-700), Archivo
  (100-900, stretch 62%-125%), Manrope (200-800), Instrument Serif (+italic),
  Bricolage Grotesque (200-800, stretch 75-100%), Unbounded (200-900).
  Never request a weight/family not declared there (QA fails missing fonts).
  No faux bold/italic.

## Hard numbers (from the knowledge base; QA enforces the starred ones)

- Canvas 1080x1350 (4:5). PDF page = same. *Body overflow = hard fail.*
- *Text floor 24px* (warn), body text >= 32px, headlines 60-110px, hook
  display 120-170px. A 1080px canvas reads at ~390px on phones (x0.36).
- Safe zone: primary text inside **80px margins** (warn outside); keep
  ~150px clear top/bottom on the panorama's text columns for platform UI.
- Contrast: body text >= 4.5:1 against its local background. QA estimates;
  the pixel critic verifies the worst-case point.
- *Canvas health (2026-07-11):* any visible canvas covering >= 25% of the
  slide FAILS qa.py if its pixels are near-uniform (dead GL frame or empty
  art layer) or its backing store is under 1.5x CSS size (WARN 1.5-1.9x).
  GL canvases must be sampleable: akthree sets preserveDrawingBuffer and
  never probes the render target (getContext fixes attributes forever).
- PDF: vector mode required (assemble_report.json `pdf_mode: "vector"`);
  target 2-25 MB.

## In this directory

- `render.py` — HTML -> PNG at 2x + in-page QA extraction (`render_report.json`)
- `qa.py` — machine gate over PNGs + report (`machine_qa.json`, exit 1 on FAIL)
- `assemble.py` — vector PDF (Chromium print + pypdf merge), contact sheet,
  432px feed thumbs (`assemble_report.json`)
- `bootstrap.sh` — pip deps (playwright, pypdf, img2pdf; Pillow/numpy present)

## Art libraries (committed, offline)

- `assets/js/noise.js` — seeded simplex 2D/3D, fbm, domain warp (`AK.*`)
- `assets/js/akgeo.js` — Alaska projection + regional zoom (`AKGeo.*`).
  NEVER fitExtent to a small lon/lat bbox (renders a giant fill disc);
  use `AKGeo.zoomTo(proj, geo, lonlat, targetXY, zoom)` and draw the
  coastline STROKE-ONLY at zoom > ~2.
- `assets/js/aktype.js` — display-headline fit-to-box (`AK.fitText`). Call
  inside renderReady after `await document.fonts.ready`:
  `AK.fitText(el, {min, max, maxLines})` binary-searches font-size so a
  large headline never silently soft-wraps an extra line into the block
  below it (the recurring wrap-collision defect through 2026-07-09). Prefer
  it over hand-tuned font-size on every display headline set in a fixed box.
- `assets/js/aklabel.js` — knockout-plate CANVAS labels (`AK.canvasLabel`).
  Any label drawn with `cx.fillText()` is a bitmap with no DOM node, so the
  QA gates (text_collisions, contrast_estimate, busy-art tripwire) are BLIND
  to it: run 2026-07-11 shipped-then-caught ~10 canvas labels at ~1.5:1 on
  the ochre band and two flag labels overprinting. `AK.canvasLabel(cx, x, y,
  text, {color, align})` draws an opaque plate under the glyphs so the
  label's contrast depends on (text, plate) only, not the art beneath, and
  returns the plate rect (`AK.rectsOverlap` to keep stacked labels apart).
  Include AFTER noise.js. Still prefer DOM/SVG text where layout allows (it
  stays vector in the PDF and the gates can see it); use this for labels that
  must be pinned to canvas coordinates.
- `assets/js/ak3d.js` — software 3D: perspective camera, heightfield/box
  meshes, painter's z-sort, Lambert + fog, 3D polylines & point clouds (`AK3D.*`)
- `assets/js/zdog.min.js` — Zdog round pseudo-3D engine (canvas, no GPU)
- `assets/js/three.module.min.js` (r170, MIT) + `assets/js/akthree.js` —
  the GPU PBR bench (PROVEN on SwiftShader in this container, ~70ms/frame at
  2160x2700): materials/rigs/IBL/lathe/tube/extrude. ES module: load via
  `<script type="module">` + `await import('@@ASSETS@@/js/...')`. RULES:
  akthree sets pixelRatio BEFORE size (hand-rolled three code that reverses
  them silently renders at 1x); `await AKT.snapshot(R)` and check `.ok`
  (black-frame sentinel: returns `{ok, variance, litCount}` and accepts a frame
  either via the historic 24-sample mean/variance OR via COVERAGE -- a dense
  strided lit-pixel count, so an OBJECT HERO that fills only part of the frame
  over a transparent/dark empty background is no longer wrongly judged dead and
  forced to the flat Canvas fallback; a genuinely black/empty frame still has
  litCount 0 and returns `ok:false`. Tune with `AKT.snapshot(R,{litFloor,litMin,stride})` only if needed);
  design a Canvas fallback for `AKT.webglOK()===false`;
  composite via an offscreen canvas + drawImage when mixing with 2D art.
  OBJECT HERO: for a single foreground object that must read as a SILHOUETTE
  against a darker background (the backlit-machine case), call
  `AKT.objectHero(R, group, {toward:[kx,ky,kz], keyColor, intensity, height})`
  after adding the group. It scales the hero to `height` (optional, the sane
  framing bump) and adds a separation rim on the FAR side of the subject from
  the camera, leaned toward the key direction (`toward`), so the contour is
  carved by a warm backlight rather than reading as a flat blob. A key-side
  rim ALONE leaves the profile flat -- run 2026-07-12 S6 needed exactly this
  by hand. Tune `intensity` up for marquee heroes and verify the edge visually
  (the RENDERED LADDER pixel gate still applies). `AKT.fitHeight(group,h)` is
  the standalone scale helper.
- `assets/js/aksdf.js` — CPU SDF raymarcher (`AKSDF.*`): organic sculpted
  heroes, soft shadows + 5-tap AO + smin blends; render 480x720 internal into
  a box, ~5-15s; `deadlineMs` degrades gracefully.
- `assets/js/akpost.js` — film grade (`AKPOST.grade`): bloom -> exposure ->
  saturation -> log-contrast -> ACES -> gamma -> split-tone -> masked grain ->
  IGN dither -> unsharp. Call ONCE on the art canvas after drawing, before
  the grain tile (or use akpost's own grain and skip the tile). DOM text is
  never affected.
- `assets/js/akcolor.js` — OKLCH engine (`AKC.*`): material ramps (chroma
  bell + warm-light/cool-shadow hue drift), OKLab gradient mixing,
  gradient-map LUT underpainting.
- `assets/js/d3.v7.min.js` + `topojson-client.min.js` — maps & dataviz
- `assets/geo/alaska-state.geo.json` — Alaska outline, true lon/lat (137 rings)
- `assets/geo/alaska-boroughs.geo.json` — all 29 boroughs/census areas
- `assets/geo/alaska-places.json` — 40+ places with lon/lat/tags + the
  canonical Alaska projection recipe:
  `d3.geoConicEqualArea().parallels([55,65]).rotate([154,0]).fitExtent(...)`
- `assets/geo/us-states-10m.json` (pre-projected AlbersUsa TopoJSON, lower-48
  context only), `assets/geo/world-land-110m.json` (unprojected TopoJSON —
  use for globes/great-circle work)

WebGL/three.js: PROVEN in this container as of 2026-07-11 (SwiftShader/ANGLE
Vulkan "Subzero"; see akthree above and examples/proof-3d). Still probe
`AKT.webglOK()` and keep a Canvas-2D fallback DESIGN per slide — headless
failure modes are silent (black frame / flat-2D fallback), which is exactly
what the snapshot sentinel catches.

## Review artifacts

The pixel critics must Read (as images): every `render/slide-XX.png` (full
size) AND `final/thumbs/slide-XX-thumb.png` (feed size) AND
`final/contact_sheet.png` (the whole deck in sequence for flow/continuity).
